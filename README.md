*atomic* is a simple CLI tool for making benchmarking easy.


<br>

## ‚ú® Features

- Detailed benchmark summary at the end
- Export the results in markdown, json, csv format
- Statistical Outlier Detection
- Plot the benchmarking data, comparing the different commands
- Arbitrary command support 
- Constant feedback about the benchmark progress and current estimates.
- Warmup runs can be executed before the actual benchmark.
- Cache-clearing commands can be set up before each timing run.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation


### Installation Scripts

#### Linux and macOS

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shravanasati/atomic/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Package Managers

#### Windows
```powershell
scoop install https://github.com/shravanasati/atomic/raw/master/scripts/atomic.json
```

### GitHub Releases

atomic binaries for all operating systems are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/shravanasati/atomic/releases/latest) tab. You can download them manually and place them on `PATH` in order to use them.

To simplify this process, you can use [eget](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget):
```
eget shravanasati/atomic
```

### Using Go compiler

If you've Go compiler (v1.21 or above) installed on your system, you can install atomic via the following command. 

```
go install github.com/shravanasati/atomic@latest
```


### Build from source

You can alternatively build atomic from source via the following commands (again, requires go1.21 or above):

```
git clone https://github.com/shravanasati/atomic.git
cd ./atomic
go build
```

If you want to build atomic in release mode (stripped binaries, compressed distribution and cross compilation), execute the following command. You can also control the release builds behavior using the [`release.config.json`](./scripts/release.config.json) file.

```
python ./scripts/build.py
```

<br>

To verify the installation of *atomic*, open a new shell and execute `atomic -v`. You should see output like this:
```
atomic 0.4.0

Version: 0.4.0
```
If the output isn't something like this, you need to repeat the above steps carefully.

## Acknowledgement

This tool is heavily inspired by [*hyperfine*](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine). I learnt a lot of stuff looking at the code of this project and tried matching the feature-set as close as possible.

## Known Issues and Missing Features

- [ ] Shell calibration yields negative process run times
- [ ] No Color functionality is broken
- [ ] Implementation of errorbar, boxplot and bubble chart is pending
- [ ] Plot command is missing

## üîñ Versioning
*atomic* releases follow semantic versioning, every release is in the *x.y.z* form, where:
- *x* is the MAJOR version and is incremented when a backwards incompatible change to atomic is made.
- *y* is the MINOR version and is incremented when a backwards compatible change to atomic is made, like changing dependencies or adding a new function, method, struct field, or type.
- *z* is the PATCH version and is incremented after making minor changes that don't affect atomic's public API or dependencies, like fixing a bug.
